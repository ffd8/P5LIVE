## SAVING
Sketches are **_ONLY_** saved in your browser's localStorage..!  
Export all (<img class="svg" src="includes/icons/download.svg" height="12px">) sketches + settings regularly.  
Clearing browser history/data will likely erase all sketches + settings.

localStorage is unique and isolated per http[s] / domain / port,  
so export/import all sketches to migrate between online / offline / browsers.  
You can now use `Settings Panel`» `Backup` » `Now` to export all settings + sketches.

*The file structure changed in v1.3, so make sure all copies of P5LIVE are up to date.  
You can import old sketches, but newly saved ones won't open in versions < 1.3.*

#### Automatic Backups
See `Settings Panel` » `Backup` to automatically export a P5LIVE backup file at varying intervals.  
If using [Fancy (nodejs) Offline Server](https://github.com/ffd8/P5LIVE#offline-server), it will save these backups to your P5LIVE folder rather than downloads.

## FEATURES
### COMPILING
There are two modes of compiling in P5LIVE:  

- softCompile, `CTRL + ENTER`, (default) replaces changed functions (smooth refresh).  
- hardCompile, `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`, forces entire sketch to recompile.  

Changes to global variables and `setup()`/`preload()` automatically perform a hardCompile since the entire sketch needs it. If your change only occurs within the `draw()` and custom functions (that aren't used in `setup()`), you should see a smooth transition. This is especially useful if using preloaded assets or drawing without a background during a performance, as it allows things to keep flowing. `Classes` are also softCompiled, but remember that each instance will still hold the old variables/methods, so replace each instance to see changes. 

A recompile when nothing has changed (and `live-coding` active), triggers a hardCompile, which is useful for clearing the background or class instances.

If in doubt or not seeing changes, run a hardCompile, `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`. 

`frameCount`, `mouseX`, `mouseY` are continous per recompile for smooth refreshes.
	
### AUTOCOMPLETE
Custom autocomplete with p5.js functions and constants has been implemented!  

<img src="includes/images/autocomplete-2.png" width="400px">  

To activate, enter the first few characters of a function and press `CTRL + SPACE`, then select function alone or with parameters. If selecting with parameters, use `TAB` to cycle through each one. Optionally activate `Auto Autocomplete` in the `Settings` to have suggestions on every keystroke.  

The auto-compiler of `live-coding` pauses whenever the auto-complete panel is active.

If you forget the name of a function, simply view the p5.js references `CTRL + R`.

### REFERENCES
After an overhaul, the built-in <img class="svg" src="includes/icons/book-open-references.svg" height="12px"> `References`, `CTRL + R`, now include nearly all information found on the official [p5.js reference website](https://p5js.org/reference/), embedded for easy lookup while potentially VJ'ing... meta-visuals! Use the  <img class="svg" src="includes/icons/gift.svg" height="12px"> to surprise yourself and view a random reference.

<img src="includes/images/refs-search-2.png" width="230px">  

Use `Search...` with keyup instant filtering to find functions you're after.  
Separate words for an *and* search, ie. `material light`.  
References keep full opacity once viewed, helping note which ones you've read. 

<img src="includes/images/refs-params-3.png" width="500px">  

Hover over functions for `parameters` tooltip, click to read the full detailed reference. 

<img src="includes/images/refs-example-1.png" width="230px">  

Beyond params and descriptions, the example's code is now embedded with js highlighting.

### CHALKBOARD
Teaching a class with P5LIVE and need to explain a mathematical concept or highlight code?  
Toggle a <img class="svg" src="includes/icons/edit.svg" height="12px"> Chalkboard from the P5LIVE Panel or shortcut `CTRL + B`.

<img src="includes/images/chalkboard-1.png" width="500px">

Use `DRAWINGS` pulldown to activate 1 of 10 isolated layers to draw on. All drawings remain until either pressing the `🗑️` clear button, DELETE key or refreshing the page. Adjust `COLOR`, `WEIGHT`, `OPACITY` of the *CHALK*, separately adjust the `COLOR` and `OPACITY` of the board (background). This enables you to completely cover up the editor/visuals below for explaining concepts. Dim the *BOARD* if annotating or highlighting code (dim opacity of *CHALK*).

You can even access the drawings within your p5 sketch!  

```
p5live.chalkboard() // grabs active drawing
p5live.chalkboard(#) // grab specific drawing (0 – 9)
```
This drawing can then be displayed and played with as a manual drawing layer within your sketch:

```
image(p5live.chalkboard(), 0, 0);
```
For examples, see `DEMOS` » `_CANVAS` » `_canvas_chalkboard` + `..._animation`


### SNIPPETS  
Add custom snippets to '/includes/demos/P5L_snippets.json'.  
Load snippet via custom shortcut, `CTRL + SHIFT + key`  

- `CTRL + SHIFT + A`, adds audio-reactive code.  
- `CTRL + SHIFT + O`, adds OSC communication code.

### LIBRARIES
P5LIVE loads p5.js/p5.sound libraries by default. For additional libraries, load them remotely via [CDN host](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) or locally if running offline (ie. `/data/libs/`). Can also be used within `SyncData`!  

Add this snippet to the top of your sketch, placing one path per array item:  

```javascript
let libs = [
	""
	,""
];
```

### HYDRA
[hydra-synth](https://github.com/ojack/hydra-synth) has been added to the P5LIVE libs and extra support has been added for writing hydra code in the global space. After importing the library, any changes made within the following tags:  

```js
// hydraSandbox
osc().out() // ... your hydra code here
// hydraSandbox
```
– will only update the hydra-synth engine and won't effect p5 recompiles! Be sure to see DEMOS » _HYDRA for details and various ways of using it in your sketches.

### ASSETS
Loading custom assets (image/font/obj/audio/...):  
 
- Remotely from a [CORS](https://enable-cors.org/resources.html) friendly server ([imgur](https://imgur.com)/[glitch.com](https://glitch.com) images/videos, [GitHub](https://github.com) raw for ~anything)  
`loadImage('https://i.imgur.com/ijQzwsx.jpeg');`
- Locally, if running offline (ie. `/data/images/`)  
`loadImage('data/images/fish.png');`

### VIEW ONLY MODE
By special request (P5LIVE for remote meditation sessions?!), there's a `view only mode`, meaning everything is hidden (code + menu) and you'll only see the sketch running. Intended for COCODING sessions, where the admin can live-code while attendees enjoy and optionally interact with the visuals using their own mic or mouse. Anytime code is recompiled, the same happens here too. Add `edit=0` to your URL:  
- COCODING, `/?cc=*****&edit=0`  
- Solo, `/?edit=0`

You can also load a sketch by URL (for media installation), just add `sketch=name_of_sketch` !  
Example: [\_meta\_P5LIVE](https://p5live.org/?sketch=_meta_P5LIVE)

### VISUALS-ONLY POPUP
Incase you want to project or stream the visuals-only (no code + interface) from P5LIVE, press <img class="svg" src="includes/icons/monitor.svg" height="12px"> within the P5LIVE Panel to launch a popup with a video feed of your P5LIVE canvas. 

### EXPORT / IMPORT
Beyond exporting all sketches regularly (**_backup!_**) – you can export single sketches and/or entire folders (click the export icon next to their name). To re-import, click the import button in the Sketches panel or simply `drag + drop` the `P5L_*****.json` into the browser.

See `Settings Panel` » `Backup` to automatically export a P5LIVE backup file at varying intervals.  

### PERFORMANCE
Lagging or retina display creates too large of a canvas?  
Use `pixelDensity(1);` in `setup()`.

### MIDI/OSC
- MIDI works online/offline and is implemented with webmidi.js  
For example, *demos/_input/_input_midi*
- OSC works offline when using node.js/npm.  
For example,  *demos/_input/_input_osc* and run Processing sketch, [p5live\_osc\_setup](https://gist.github.com/ffd8/f9f33cc7461f8467f62d5a792dde53ca)  
or use the OSC snippet (`CTRL + SHIFT + O`) and set host/in/out ports.  

### BUG/CRASH?! 
Infinite loop? Broken code? P5LIVE now ships includes an infinite loop breaker, thus rendering previous tricks more or less obsolete... nevertheless, these may still be useful:

- Add `#bug` to URL and press `ENTER`.  
Stops compiler, loads a new sketch and opens inspector to fix issue and save.
- Add `#new` to URL and press `ENTER`.  
Loads a new sketch.
- If the browser has completely hung, (rare issue between MBP/Chrome/libraries)  
`sudo killall coreaudiod` (first take off headphones + turndown stereo!)

*Incase you need a loop to run more than 10000 times ||  1 second,  
add `// noprotect` anywhere in your code.*

### EXTRA FUNCTIONS
Additional custom functions are available in P5LIVE sketches:  

- `ease(inValue, outVariable, easeValue)`  smooth values.  
- `println(foo)` Compatibility with Processing.  
- `windowResize()` is set by default to keep your sketch fullscreen. To disable, add `windowResized = null;` in the setup() or overwrite with custom function.


## COCODING

- Toggle write-access, admin can always toggle write access per user. 

#### Chat
<img src="includes/images/menu-cocoding-chat-2.png" width="220px">   

Within chat, links are parsed, ie. share sketch from p5.js editor.  
Incoming chats displayed as notification (if active) when menu is hidden.

#### SyncData
<img src="includes/images/menu-cocoding-syncdata-2.png" width="220px">  

<img class="svg" src="includes/icons/radio.svg" height="12px"> launches SyncData window.  

<img src="includes/images/menu-cocoding-syncdata-window-2.png" width="400px">   

Use the SyncData window to send local data (as objects), by entering custom code that's executed locally in parallel to the shared COCODING session. Latest changes to the SyncData editor are stored in your local settings. Selecting a new preset replaces its contents, so use `Save Preset` to store anything long-term.  

**Presets**  

- `template` guide for making your own.  
- `mouseXY`, `facetracker` + `midi`, shares those signals with others.  
Be sure to enter unique `userID`'s.
- `Save Preset` for storing current SyncData editor (pre-existing name replaces it).
- `Remove Preset` is available after selecting a custom preset.

**Buttons**  

- `► RUN` activates SyncData, injecting code at end of COCODE on each recompile.
- `► RE-RUN` updates any changes made within SyncData editor.
- `↓ COCODE` (admin) adds code following `/* 2 - COCODE */` into COCODING session.
- `◼ STOP` deactivates SyncData (stops adding local code to recompile).

<img src="includes/images/menu-cocoding-syncdata-radio-1.png" width="220px"> 

When active, your own <img class="svg" src="includes/icons/radio.svg" height="12px"> turns green, along with any user who is sending data.  
<img class="svg" src="includes/icons/lock.svg" height="12px"> Lockdown mode, suspends SyncData for all users, unless given write-access.  

All data sent, uses `parseData()` in COCODING session to access it. Events can be fired immediately, or pass values to global vars for use within `draw()`. Furthermore you can use `getData()` within COCODING session, for unique local processing within your own SyncData window and code. See `midi` preset for use-case, where `midiThru` receives incoming signals and passes them onward to your own gear.

Be kind to your peers, keep data size and intervals within reasonable values.  
Have fun COCODING with keyboards, EEG-headsets, eye-trackers, ....?! 


## OFFLINE SERVER
### Basic - Python  
Use for quickest setup or to run multiple instances (each with their own sketches storage).  
NO COCODING + OSC with this technique.  

- Clone / Download [P5LIVE](https://github.com/ffd8/p5live)  
- MacOS – open `Terminal` // Windows – open `command prompt`  
- type `cd` + `SPACEBAR` + drag/drop P5LIVE folder into window, press `ENTER` 
- check Python version, type `python --version`, press `ENTER` 
	- `Python 2.0+`, type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000`, press `ENTER`    
	- `Python 3.0+`, type `python -m http.server 5000`, press `ENTER`    
- P5LIVE is live! visit » [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- To quit, `CTRL + C` in Terminal (or command prompt)

Port `5000` is suggested, for alternative, just type desired one in snippet above and remember P5LIVE sketches are stored in localstorage which is unique per `domain:port`

### Fancy - nodejs/npm  
Use for all features (COCODING + OSC) + optional HTTPS mode. 
  
- Clone / Download [P5LIVE](https://github.com/ffd8/p5live)  
- Install Node.js + NPM ([binary installers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))  
- MacOS – open `Terminal` // Windows – open `command prompt`  
- type `cd` + `SPACEBAR` + drag/drop P5LIVE folder into window, press `ENTER`  
- type `npm install`, press `ENTER`  
- type `npm start`, press `ENTER`  (for custom port: `npm start ####`)
- P5LIVE is live! visit » [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- To quit, `CTRL + C` in Terminal (or command prompt)

Port `5000` is suggested, for alternative, add desired port number to start command above, ie: `npm start 5010`. Remember P5LIVE sketches are stored in localstorage which is unique per `domain:port`

### HTTPS
If using **Fancy** offline server, you may want to COCODE with peers on the same local network. With p5.sound always enabled, a `localhost` or `https` connection is now required regardless of mic being active. While you are `localhost`, any connected peers are simply `http`, therefore we can use an http-proxy to tunnel `https` traffic to our `localhost`!

#### Local (same network, works offline):    
- Start P5LIVE with `npm start https`, or custom port `npm start #### https`  
- HTTPS port is automatically 1 digit higher than P5LIVE (5000 » 5001).  
- Share https address displayed in Terminal, ie: `https://xxxxx.local:5001`  
- Connected peers must accept 'unsecure' (self-gen) certificate with `Advanced` button upon loading URL. Certificates are generative + cached, renewing after 60 days.  
- Enjoy Offline Server COCODING!  

#### Remote (anyone across internet w/ [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs#getting-started)!):  
- Start P5LIVE offline server (see above)  
- [Download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)  
- Open another tab in Terminal, `cd` to the folder containing **ngrok**  
- Type `ngrok http 5000` and press `ENTER` (tunnels to localhost:5000)  
- Check output for forwarding URL to share with remote peers:  
`https://########.ngrok.io`  
- Enjoy Online [Self-hosted] Server COCODING!
